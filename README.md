This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in JavaScript when interacting with the DOM: attempting to access and modify an element that doesn't exist.  The example uses the getElementById method which returns null if the element isn't found, resulting in an error when trying to use its innerHTML property. The solution shows how to properly check for the element's existence before attempting to modify it.
